	Hello!
	Fun fact, this isn't the first time I've had a blog thing on this website.
	Around mid-2019, there was a really janky system I had set up where the homepage would
	ask Dropbox for a plaintext file, which would then be piped into a text box on the home page.
	I'm pretty sure I only ever updated it twice before removing it after I noticed the network I
	was using at the time completely blocked Dropbox for some reason. This is more reliable.
	It also means I use fancy HTML stuff like <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>.
	This isn't a gopher site. Although, I would like to get into gopher. It's an interesting protocol
	that was competing with HTTP in the beginning days of the internet, but lost out. I suppose
	content creators and businesses don't care much for plaintext with some links in. Anyway, this should hopefully
	be a decent place for me to put my thoughts to words. Let's hope no <ins title='You know who.'>politicians</ins> ruin it.
